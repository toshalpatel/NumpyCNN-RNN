# Numpy implementation of basic layers used in CNNs and RNNs

## requirements
### python version
- python3

### python package
- wget
- tensorflow 1.14.0 (pip install tensorflow==1.14.0)
- keras
- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter
- pandas
- nltk

These libraries are for comparing my numpy implementation with the libraries implementation

## introduction

This is an numpy implementation of some basic components for training convolutional neural network (CNN) over the Fashion_MNIST dataset and recurrent neural network (RNN) over the NLTK dataset.

x_main.py files are to compare the implementation of basic functions in numpy with those of the keras/tf libraries.
