# Numpy implementation of basic layers used in CNNs and RNNs

## requirements
### python version
- python3

### python package
- wget
- tensorflow 1.14.0 (pip install tensorflow==1.14.0)
- keras
- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter
- pandas
- nltk

These libraries are for checking my numpy implementation with the libraries implementation

## introduction

In this assignemnt, the task is to implement some basic components for training convolutional neural network (CNN) over the Fashion_MNIST dataset and recurrent neural network (RNN) over the NLTK dataset. You need to follow the lecture notes to
- implement the RMSProp algorithm in nn/optimizers.py
- implement multiple operations in nn/operators.py, which are used by the layers (in nn/layer.py)
- implement the forward function of Bi-directional RNN (in nn/layer.py)
- tune the model architecture and some hyperparameters to improve the accuracy.
