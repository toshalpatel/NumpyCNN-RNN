## introduction

In this assignemnt, the task is to implement some basic components for training convolutional neural network (CNN) over the Fashion_MNIST dataset and recurrent neural network (RNN) over the NLTK dataset. You need to follow the lecture notes to
- implement the RMSProp algorithm in nn/optimizers.py
- implement multiple operations in nn/operators.py, which are used by the layers (in nn/layer.py)
- implement the forward function of Bi-directional RNN (in nn/layer.py)
- tune the model architecture and some hyperparameters to improve the accuracy.
